# Net Neutrality
### Why neutrality is necessary
![Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/images/share_images/urgent.png)

---

## What is Net Neutrality?
* Net neutrality is the principle that regulating agents of the internet must treat all data on the internet the same.
* I am for Net Neutrality.

---

## Why not Net Neutrality?
* Only people opposing are ISPs
* Why?
  * Would allow ISPs to charge more money for something that should be free.
* ISPs *could* do this and likely would if there were no restrictions; we have an ISP monopoly right now.

---

## Damages caused without Net Neutrality
* Everyone gets hurt without Net Neutrality.
* Creators get hurt
  * I'm a small creator on the internet. Without restricting ISPs, this website would likely be slowed down.
  * Big creators could also be hurt. Because Netflix is such a huge company, ISPs could see reasons to charge them for faster data. Netflix might pass this charge on to their subscribers or suffer losses.
* Consumers are at a loss, as well. While ISPs could theoretically lower prices for consumers, but there would often be charges for fast lanes.

---

## What do we get with Net Neutrality?
* Google and Wikipedia are the two largest examples of what we get with Net Neutrality. Both organizations were small, garage-based organizations before their presence on the internet was picked up by consumers.
